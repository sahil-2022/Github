# Password_Generator
The password generator project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate strong and secure passwords based on their specified requirements. Users can input their desired password length and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The JavaScript code generates a random password by combining characters from the selected sets and displays it on the web page. Additional features like a strength meter and exclusion of similar characters can be included for enhanced usability and security. The project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for generating robust passwords.
